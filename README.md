## svg-flowgraph
svg-flowgraph provides the basic scaffolding and utilities for small/medium graphs that needs to be highly customizable and interactive.

svg-flowgraph is _NOT_ a layout engine, rather it expects users to provide layout-adapter implementations to transform the output into a compatible format.
